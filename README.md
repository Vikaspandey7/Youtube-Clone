# Youtube-Clone


Hello and welcome to my Github profile!

My name is Vikaskumar Pandey and I am a frontend web developer with a strong interest in building visually appealing and user-friendly web applications. I am excited to share with you my first project on Github, a front-end YouTube clone.

This project was developed as part of my learning journey in frontend web development. It is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project was to create a replica of the Facebook user interface, focusing on the front-end design.

Some of the features of this Facebook clone include:

A responsive layout: The clone has been designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
User authentication: Users can sign up, login, and logout securely.
User profiles: Users have their own profiles where they can upload a profile picture, update their status, and view their activity.
News feed: Users can view a chronological feed of posts from their friends and themselves.
Post creation: Users can create and share posts with their friends.
Comments and likes: Users can comment and like posts from their friends.
While this project is not meant to be a perfect replica of Facebook, it served as a great way to reinforce my web development skills and gain hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I look forward to building on this project and implementing new features in the future.

Thank you for taking the time to view my profile and check out my front-end Facebook clone project. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to me!
